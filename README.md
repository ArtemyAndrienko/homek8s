# homek8s
Installation, setup, and build home server apps running on microk8s and a ubuntu host.

The purpose of this repos is to document the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster, running  and monitoring it, and building and deploying apps to run on it. The repos is a record of learning focussing on how the system is built, rather than why it was done that way. 

The information described in this repository relates a single node `microk8s` cluster hosted on Ubuntu running on a hardware host.
